    "question": "Regression Evaluation Metrics",
    "answer": "MAE, RMSE, RAE, RSE, CoD(R2)\n MAE sums residauals from mean, RMSE is square of residuals mean and squared, RAE is absolute error divided by a simple predictor (the error from mean), RSE is the same as RAE just that it uses the squared error. Coefficient of Determination aka R2 is a 0 to 1 metric based on how large the prop of dependent variable is predicted based on independent variable(s)."
